    "productionProcessText": "The production of kumis is a complex and multifaceted process that requires special skill and knowledge. It all starts with milking mares, which is an art in itself. Knowing how to properly milk a mare is the first and crucial step that requires certain skills and experience. Fresh mare's milk is collected in special containers where the fermentation process begins. The milk is mixed with a starter culture containing lactic acid bacteria and yeast, which convert lactose into lactic acid and alcohol. This process can take from several hours to several days, depending on the temperature and fermentation conditions. It is important to maintain the right temperature and humidity to ensure ideal conditions for the development of bacteria and yeast. Traditional kumis production uses wooden barrels or leather bags, which impart a special aroma and taste to the drink. After fermentation, kumis is bottled and aged for a few more days to achieve the optimal taste and texture. Modern technologies allow some stages of production to be automated, but true connoisseurs of kumis always value traditional methods. Bashkir kumis is distinguished by its high quality due to the use of special breeds of mares and adherence to strict production standards. It is also important to note that kumis is a living product, and its quality depends on many factors, including the nutrition and conditions of the animals.",
